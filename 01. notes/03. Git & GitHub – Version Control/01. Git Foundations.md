<summary><strong>0. Introduction – Why Version Control Matters</strong></summary>

Before Git, developers kept zipping folders as  
`project_final.zip → project_final_v2.zip → final_realfinal.zip`.  
Collaboration was chaos, and history was fragile.

**Git** changed that — it became a *time machine* for code.  
It tracks *what changed, when, and by whom* — and lets teams roll back or branch without fear.

In DevOps, Git is the **source of truth**.  
Tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Terraform rely on it to detect, version, and automate infrastructure.

```

Edit → Stage → Commit → Push → Collaborate

```

Git works locally on your machine, but can sync with **remote repositories** on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

<summary><strong>1. Installing Git – Setting Up Your Environment</strong></summary>

### Windows
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).  
2. Run the installer and click **Next** through default options.  
3. This installs **Git** and **Git Bash** — a terminal that supports Unix-style commands.  
4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   git --version
```

Example output:
`git version 2.43.0.windows.1`

### macOS

```bash
brew install git
```

Or download the `.dmg` from git-scm.com and drag it to Applications.

### Linux (Ubuntu example)

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Default Editor

During install, Git asks for a default editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad).
You can change anytime:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

### PATH Environment

Ensure Git is added to your PATH so you can use it in any terminal.
Check with:

```bash
git --version
```

If not found, restart your terminal or add:

```
C:\Program Files\Git\bin
```

to your system PATH.

**Common Installation Issues**

| Problem                  | Fix                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `git: command not found` | Add Git to PATH and reopen terminal.       |
| Permission denied        | Run as Administrator or use `sudo`.        |
| Wrong version            | Update using package manager or reinstall. |

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Git Config – Defining Your Identity</strong></summary>

Before committing, Git must know who you are.
Each commit carries your name and email — your *digital signature.*

### Set Global Identity

```bash
git config --global user.name "Akhil Teja Doosari"
git config --global user.email "doosariakhilteja@gmail.com"
```

### Check Your Settings

```bash
git config --list
```

You’ll see:

```
user.name=Akhil Teja Doosari
user.email=doosariakhilteja@gmail.com
```

### Understanding Config Levels

| Level      | Flag       | Location         | Affects      | Typical Use                |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| **System** | `--system` | `/etc/gitconfig` | All users    | Company-wide defaults      |
| **Global** | `--global` | `~/.gitconfig`   | Your user    | Personal identity          |
| **Local**  | `--local`  | `.git/config`    | Current repo | Project-specific overrides |

**Priority:**
`Local → Global → System`

Example:

```bash
git config --local user.email "akhil@company.com"
```

<summary><strong>3. Creating a Repository – The Project’s Birth</strong></summary>

A **repository (repo)** is a folder Git watches for changes.

### Steps

```bash
mkdir myproject       # Create folder
cd myproject          # Enter folder
git init              # Initialize Git
```

This creates a hidden folder `.git/` containing all version history.

Check it:

```bash
ls -a
```

Output:

```
.  ..  .git
```

You now have an **empty repository** ready to track files.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Understanding Tracked vs Untracked Files</strong></summary>

A new file you create is **untracked** until you tell Git to monitor it.

Example:

```bash
echo "<h1>Hello Git!</h1>" > index.html
git status
```

Output:

```
Untracked files:
  index.html
```

* **Untracked files** — exist in your folder but not yet added.
* **Tracked files** — Git is monitoring them for changes.

You can view files in the directory:

```bash
ls
```

To begin tracking:

```bash
git add index.html
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. The Staging Environment – The Waiting Room</strong></summary>

The **staging area (index)** is a buffer between your edits and permanent history.
Think of it as a *checklist before committing.*

| Command                       | Meaning                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `git add <file>`              | Stage a specific file      |
| `git add .` or `git add -A`   | Stage all changes          |
| `git status`                  | Check what’s staged or not |
| `git restore --staged <file>` | Unstage a file             |

Example:

```bash
git add index.html
git status
```

Output:

```
Changes to be committed:
  new file: index.html
```

If you added the wrong file:

```bash
git restore --staged index.html
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Commit – Capturing Your Project’s Timeline</strong></summary>

A **commit** is a snapshot of your staged files — a save point in history.

### Create a Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Add homepage"
```

Each commit includes:

* Your name and email
* Date and message
* A unique **commit hash**

---

### What’s a Commit Hash?

Every commit is identified by a **SHA-1 hash**, a 40-character fingerprint:

```
1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b
```

Short form (first 7 chars) is enough for reference:

```
1a2b3c4
```

Git uses these hashes for everything — branching, tagging, stashing, reverting.

---

### View History

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Example:

```
a12f45c Add homepage
b78d23d Fix CSS
c91e7ef Update README
```

---

### Amend Last Commit (before pushing)

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Refine homepage layout"
```

<summary><strong>7. Git Workflow – From Edit to Push</strong></summary>

Here’s the natural rhythm of every Git project:

```bash
git init                      # Create a repo
git add .                     # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Initial commit" # Snapshot your work
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main       # Push to GitHub
```

  <br><em>Figure: Core Git workflow from local edit to remote collaboration</em>
</p>

**Pulling Updates**

```bash
git pull
```

Fetches and merges new changes from the remote repository.

**Typical Workflow Summary**

```
Edit → git status → git add → git commit → git push
```

<summary><strong>8. Best Practices & Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

### Best Practices

* Commit **frequently** with short, meaningful messages.
* Check status often:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```
* Stage **only** what’s intentional.
* Push regularly to back up work.
* Review before committing:

  ```bash
  git diff
  ```
* Keep commits atomic — one logical change per commit.

### Common Issues

| Issue                         | Fix                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Accidentally added wrong file | `git restore --staged <file>`                      |
| Commit message typo           | `git commit --amend`                               |
| Merge conflicts               | Open files, resolve, then `git add` + `git commit` |
| Permission denied (push)      | Ensure correct GitHub credentials or SSH setup     |
| Detached HEAD                 | `git switch <branch>` to return to a branch        |

<summary><strong>9. Mentor Insight</strong></summary>

At this stage, Git is your **personal timeline manager** — every edit, every snapshot, every sync.
You now understand how work flows from *local creation* to *shared collaboration*.

Next, you’ll learn how to **pause work safely and mark milestones** —
through **Git Stash** and **Git Tags**, the natural continuation of your Inside-Out mastery path.
