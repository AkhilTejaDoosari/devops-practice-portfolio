# DevOps Practice Portfolio

This repository contains my DevOps notes and practical work, organized for consistent revision and execution.

## Why this repository exists
Many people jump between tools without building strong fundamentals.  
This repository follows an **inside-out** approach — starting with system basics and building toward modern DevOps workflows.

## Repository structure
- **notes/**  
  Topic-wise notes (Linux, Bash, Git, Networking, AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)

- **labs/** *(in progress)*  
  Small repeatable exercises to build command-level confidence and troubleshooting ability

- **projects/** *(planned)*  
  End-to-end implementations that combine multiple tools into real workflows

## Learning approach
Linux → Bash → Git → Networking → AWS → Terraform → Docker → Kubernetes → CI/CD → Observability

Focus areas:
- concept clarity
- repeatable practice
- debugging and troubleshooting

## Current status
✅ Notes are available under `notes/`  
🚧 Labs will be added gradually  
🚧 Projects will be added after core labs are stable
