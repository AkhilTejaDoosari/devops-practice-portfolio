<summary><strong>1. When Things Go Wrong – The Need for Recovery</strong></summary>

Mistakes happen — a wrong commit, deleted branch, or reset gone bad.  
Git provides multiple *safety nets* to fix or roll back issues without losing history.

Think of these tools as **three layers of recovery:**

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|
| Surface | `git commit --amend` | Fix your last commit (message or files). |
| Mid-Level | `git revert` | Undo older commits safely with new commits. |
| Deep Recovery | `git reflog` / `git reset` | Restore lost work or move to any past state. |

Together, they form Git’s **time machine** — allowing you to go back, fix, and move forward safely.

<summary><strong>2. Revert – Safely Undoing Published Commits</strong></summary>

`git revert` creates a new commit that **reverses the changes** of an earlier commit without deleting history.

### Why Use It
- You accidentally introduced a bug.  
- You need to roll back one specific commit.  
- You want to keep the project history clean and intact.  

**Analogy:** Like crossing out a line in a notebook instead of tearing the page — the record remains.

---

### Basic Commands
| Command | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `git revert HEAD` | Undo the latest commit |
| `git revert <commit-hash>` | Undo a specific commit |
| `git revert HEAD~2` | Undo a commit two steps back |
| `git revert --no-edit` | Skip editing commit message |
| `git log --oneline` | View history to identify commits |

---

### Example
Find the commit to undo:
```bash
git log --oneline
````

Then revert:

```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```

Output:

```
[main e56ba1f] Revert "Added feature X"
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
```

A **new commit** is added that cancels the old one — history remains intact.

---

### Troubleshooting

| Issue                 | Solution                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Conflict occurs       | Fix manually → `git add .` → `git revert --continue` |
| Want to cancel revert | `git revert --abort`                                 |
| Want to skip a revert | `git revert --skip`                                  |

---

**When to Use**

* In shared repos where others may have pulled your commits.
* To undo specific commits safely without altering history.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Amend – Fixing the Most Recent Commit</strong></summary>

`git commit --amend` lets you **rewrite your last commit** — perfect for quick corrections.

---

### When to Use

* You forgot to include a file.
* Your message had a typo.
* You want to replace or remove a file from the last commit.

⚠️ Only use amend on **local commits** (not yet pushed).

---

### Fix a Commit Message

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Corrected commit message"
```

### Add Forgotten Files

```bash
git add newfile.txt
git commit --amend
```

### Remove a File

```bash
git reset HEAD^ -- unwanted.txt
git commit --amend
```

After amending, the **commit hash changes** — Git treats it as a new commit.

---

### Review Changes

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Before:

```
07c5bc5 (HEAD -> main) Addd lines to redme
```

After:

```
eaa69ce (HEAD -> main) Added lines to README.md
```

---

### Warnings

* Avoid amending commits that were already pushed.
* Rewriting shared history can cause merge conflicts.

**Analogy:** Like editing your last sent message before anyone sees it — safe if unread, risky if already read.

<summary><strong>4. Reset – Moving the Pointer (Local Rollback)</strong></summary>

`git reset` moves your **HEAD** pointer to a specific commit and optionally modifies the staging or working directory.

---

### Modes of Reset

| Command                                  | Effect                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `git reset --soft <commit>`              | Move HEAD, keep changes staged                    |
| `git reset --mixed <commit>` *(default)* | Move HEAD, unstage changes but keep them in files |
| `git reset --hard <commit>`              | Move HEAD and **erase** working directory changes |
| `git reset <file>`                       | Unstage specific file only                        |

---

### Example

Find the target commit:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Then reset:

```bash
git reset --soft 9a9add8
```

→ Moves HEAD to that commit; keeps changes staged for new commit.

---

### Visual Summary

```
--soft  → HEAD moves, files stay staged
--mixed → HEAD moves, files unstaged
--hard  → HEAD moves, files erased
```

---

### Warnings

* **Reset rewrites history.** Never use it on shared branches.
* Use `revert` instead when collaborating.
* Always check with `git status` after reset.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Reflog – Recovering Lost Work</strong></summary>

`git reflog` records every update to the tip of branches and `HEAD`, even those unreachable by normal history.
It’s your **“black box recorder”** — tracking every move.

---

### When to Use

* You lost commits after a reset or rebase.
* A branch was deleted by mistake.
* You want to travel back in time.

---

### View Reflog

```bash
git reflog
```

Example output:

```
e56ba1f (HEAD -> main) HEAD@{0}: commit: Revert feature
52418f7 HEAD@{1}: commit: Update README
9a9add8 HEAD@{2}: commit: Added .gitignore
```

Each line shows where HEAD has been — every commit, checkout, or reset.

---

### Recover Lost Commits

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

or

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

You’ve effectively time-traveled to an earlier state.

---

### Restore Deleted Branch

```bash
git branch feature-recovered <commit-hash>
```

---

### Clean Up Reflog

Old entries expire automatically, but you can prune them:

```bash
git reflog expire --expire=30.days refs/heads/main
git gc --prune=now
```

---

### Key Notes

* Reflog is **local only** — not synced to remote.
* It expires (90 days default).
* Always push branches you want to preserve permanently.

<summary><strong>6. Best Practices & Guardrails</strong></summary>

| Action                      | Use                           | Avoid                            |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Minor local fix             | `git commit --amend`          | After pushing to shared repo     |
| Undo specific public commit | `git revert`                  | `git reset --hard`               |
| Undo multiple local commits | `git reset --soft`            | On shared branches               |
| Lost commit recovery        | `git reflog` + `git checkout` | Ignoring reflog before panicking |

**Golden Rule:**
👉 *Revert for shared safety, Reset for private cleanup.*

<summary><strong>7. Mentor Insight</strong></summary>

Mistakes in Git aren’t failures — they’re checkpoints for learning.
Every commit, even a wrong one, leaves a trail you can recover from.

The tools you’ve learned are not about “going back,” but about **moving forward responsibly**:

* `amend` fixes the present,
* `revert` respects the past,
* `reset` repositions the pointer,
* `reflog` restores what seemed lost.

You’ve now mastered not just version control — but **version recovery**.
Git isn’t unforgiving; it’s built for second chances.
